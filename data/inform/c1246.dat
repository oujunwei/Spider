冷泉麻子"," 【2029】大约50分钟前，警察突于fb专页发布一条介绍「颜色水」的影片。影片提到，「颜色水」可于「流动高压液喷装置」或背负的催泪水剂喷射器发射。换言之，颜料可加入在催泪水中使用。 如被喷射颜料水，会残留在身体或衣服表面，警方能借此辨认个别人士是否身在示威现场。有关装置已完成测试及训练，可随时使用。https://t.me/antiextraditionverifiednews/1117  姐系水炮车未完成训练同测试 The ATPR powder is useful in situations where you need a visible stain detection. The ATPR powder normally has a dark green / brown appearance. However, once the powder becomes moist from the moisture in skin, water, alcohol, acetone or just about any liquid substance, the powder changes to a highly visible purple stain. The stain is very difficult to get remove. Water, alcohol, acetone and other solvents do not remove the stain.   Depending on how long somebody washes a stain, how much staining occurred and the type of soap or cleaner used, you can expect the stain to last 1 to 3 days on skin. On something like white carpeting, the stain will likely be permanent.  The ATPR powder can be extremely messy, so be very careful in using it. Very slight specks that are near invisible to the eye will turn violent purple on contact with water. Be careful about the items you mark since it will be difficult to remove the powder without staining the item.  防盗粉都要1-3日先清到 暂时解决方法我谂得雨褛同防水喷雾","4/8/2019 20:50

冷泉麻子","These powders and pastes are usually applied to articles subject to theft or tampering such as currency, paper money, alarm boxes, cash drawers, etc. The color of the powder or paste selected should be compatible to the surface color of the article being treated. Upon direct contact with the article, the suspect can be easily identified by the incriminating stain on his/her hands. The special dye formulation actually intensifies and spreads once the thief attempts to wash off the stain. Usually the stain remains on the hands and clothing for days, even after several attempts to wash it off.  GOOGLE左一阵都冇咩解决方法对付D防盗水","4/8/2019 20:57
