The Chief Secretary said the government was keen to alleviate worries that the bill would have a negative impact on Hong Kong's status as an international business hub. AmCham's Position on the Bill AmCham feels that there are too many uncertainties in fundamental sections of the proposed legislation that must be addressed and explained to the broader Hong Kong community before tabling the bill for passage by the Legislative Council. Hong Kong is not ready to see this bill passed, and we do not see why it should be rushed through when the loophole it seeks to address has existed for 20 years. We believe that for Hong Kong to remain a center of excellence for the rule of law and legal practice that due legislative process is followed. We have asked the Chief Secretary’s office for answers to the following questions: AmCham's Questions 1. With 30 foreign diplomats reportedly indicating that they do not support the ordinance and that this may lead to a review of their home countries relationship with Hong Kong, how does the government plan to address these concerns to avoid any negative impact on Hong Kong’s international hub status? 2. Three senior judges in Hong Kong publicly announced they are “deeply disturbed” by the proposed bill and saw the bill as “unworkable” because its amendments ignored the lack of trust in the legal system of mainland China. If one of the bill’s two main gatekeepers – the courts – feel the proposed legislation is unworkable, how will the government ensure that the rule of law in Hong Kong is not compromised if this legislation is forced ahead?","30/5/2019 17:53

While it was once said extradition requests could only be made by any recognized individuals from the Central People’s Government, the Security Bureau also noted that “extradition requests would come from Mainland China courts, which are not internationally held in the same regard as Hong Kong’s.” Please kindly clarify. 4. Secretary for Security John Lee highlighted that the amendments are “mainly aimed at fugitives who have committed serious crimes and do not affect Hong Kong’s freedom of the press and speech as safeguarded in the Basic Law and Hong Kong Law.” How will they be safeguarded technically? 5. In the government’s reply to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission it was said that the ordinance amendments help establish the reputation of Hong Kong in combating crimes. Why would Hong Kong want to risk its reputation for the rule of law in order to gain this new reputation of “combating crimes” with the city’s relatively low crime rate? 6. The government emphasized that the amendments focus only on fugitives, but not local ordinary citizens. How will this be differentiated? 7. Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng said the government would consider including a requirement that a requesting jurisdiction would guarantee suspects a fair trial. How will the Hong Kong Government ensure the requesting jurisdiction guarantees a fair trial? 8. Media reports noted that the “Security Bureau admitted that, with the amendments to the extradition law, the Chinese government can request the freezing of the assets of a person deemed to be a fugitive from the mainland” Please provide more details on this to ensure business confidence is not at risk. https://thestandnews.com/politics/%E9%80%83%E7%8A%AF%E6%A2%9D%E4%BE%8B-%E6%9C%83%E6%99%A4%E5%BC%B5%E5%BB%BA%E5%AE%97%E5%BE%8C%E6%9C%AA%E9%87%8B%E7%96%91-%E7%BE%8E%E5%95%86%E6%9C%83%E5%85%AB%E5%95%8F%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C/","30/5/2019 17:53

抑郁毒心神探","【逃犯条例】美国商会昨晤张建宗　今发强硬声明反修例　向政府提八大质问政府强推《逃犯条例》修订，引发国际社会关注，香港美国商会今日发出新闻稿，指昨日曾和政务司司长张建宗会面，商会表明对修例的关注，引述张建宗称政府乐于解说，希望可以释除疑虑，但商会明显「不收货」，在新闻稿中表明，认为香港未准备好修例，不明白为何政府要急于堵塞已经存在超过 20 年的制度漏洞，更向政府提出八大质问，要求政府交代，包括修例如何保障香港作为国际枢纽的地位、如何确保香港法治不会受损、 如何保障被移交逃犯会得到公平审讯等。美商会的声明指，商会昨日和政务司司长张建宗会面，表达商会对修例的关注，张建宗指政府乐于解说，但商会认为修例仍有太多根本性的不确定因素，在立法会通过修例前有必要向社会大众进一步解释，又指香港未准备好通过修例，亦不明白为何特区政府要急于修例，以堵塞存在超过 20 年的制度漏洞。声明强调，香港的成功来自法治和合规的立法程序，商会已向政务司司长张建宗办公室，提出八大质问，要求对方解答。美国商会提出质问，大部份语调强硬，包括要求特区交代，已有 30 名外交官向特区政府表明，不支持修例，修例更可能改变香港和其他国家的外交关系，特区政府有何计划，可以避免香港作为国际枢纽的地位动摇。声明又指，有三名香港资深法官受访，表明修例不可行，因为修例根本没有处理对内地司法制度缺乏信心的问题，商会质疑若草案两大「守门人」之一，法庭都认为修例不可行，特区政府如何可以确保强行修例不会损害香港法治。声明续指，特区政府在回复美中经济暨安全检讨委员会时，指修例有助建立香港打击犯罪的名声，但香港犯罪率一直都偏低，商会质疑港府为何要冒着法治受损的风险，去尝试建立打击犯罪的名声。商会又要求政府交代，保安局局长李家超曾强调，修例主要针对犯严重罪行的逃犯，不会危害香港的言论和新闻自由，具体有何保障措施；律政司司长郑若骅曾称，会考虑加入条款保证疑犯获得公平审讯，特区政府会如何执行；政府强调修例只针对逃犯而不是普通市民，政府又会如何分辨。声明又提及，修例后内地那些部门有权提出移交要求有不同说法，要求政府澄清，有报道指中国政府可以要求港府冻结移犯资产，亦要求政府提供更多资讯。香港美国商会有约 1400 个会员，是香港最大的外资商会，商会理事会成员包括来自 Fedex、怡安保险、IBM、Google 香港等企业的高层。https://thestandnews.com/politics/逃犯条例-美国商会昨晤张建宗-今发强硬声明反修例-向政府提八大质问","30/5/2019 22:38
