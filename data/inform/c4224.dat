哈哈大件事","记得send埋图, 塞爆佢 inbox... 可能佢肯发声Hello Emma,We're writing to express concern over an incident involving the violation of female rights that has just happened in Hong Kong. As you may have noticed, Hong Kongers are currently experiencing police brutality on a daily basis during the process of fighting aginst the extradition bill imposed by the HK government. Earlier just now a female protestor was arrested near a local police station, during which her pants were violently ripped off against her will. The police officers made no attempt to protect her privacy which was unacceptable on any level. Since the beginning of the protests in June not one of our local feminist organizations have stood out for female rights. We are in desperate times and sincerely seek your help in raising international concern over this matter as we can foresee more inicidents like this one are going to happen in the near future if nothing is done to stop poice brutality. Thanks a lot for your time!A group of concerned Hong Kongers","5/8/2019 03:47
