抑郁毒心神探","SHOULD THE FOO BE REVIEWED?6. The primary legislation which currently governs the arrangements for surrender of fugitive offenders between Hong Kong and foreign countries is the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance (the “FOO”) (Cap. 503).7. The law of and procedure for mutual legal assistance in criminal matters is contained in the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance (Cap. 525).8. In the past 22 years after its enactment in 1997, the FOO received only piecemeal and minor updates. In this period of time, there have been (a) rapid socio-economic developments in Hong Kong, and (b) substantial developments in the local jurisprudence in public law and human rights compliance, such as non-refoulement protection. In the same period of time, extradition laws in various countries have progressed. Examples are the enactments of the Extradition Act 2003 in the United Kingdom and the Extradition Act 1999 in Canada.9. Subject to the international criminal law regime and the fundamental protection of human rights, we consider that extradition is an important tool in dealing with international crime. A comprehensive review and update in the extradition1 regime of Hong Kong in our view is required.","6/6/2019 15:44
抑郁毒心神探","10. The above review should embrace, for example, a detailed study of criminal jurisdictions of different countries. There should also be an extensive consultation with the stakeholders and the community. The process takes time. Given the effect of participating in the international system of extraditing wanted persons, before the above proposed review is concluded, if the HKSAR Government is justifiably required to address and to deal with urgent requests to surrender fugitives to regions which have not entered into formal bilateral surrender agreements, then in principle we do not have strong objection to a case-by-case surrender arrangement. This however should only be a “makeshift measure” and is subject to(a) the provision of additional safeguards suggested below, for the purposes that(i) the accused Hong Kong person should have the right to dispute and resist the extradition request,(ii) the overall extradition arrangement under the Bill should be made more transparent to the general public, and(iii) the Hong Kong courts should have more power to oversee extradition requests;(b) the Government’s commitment to step up its efforts to negotiate with those legal jurisdictions which have not yet entered into formal bilateral treaties or agreements for surrender of fugitives.11. As the special surrender arrangements now proposed in the Bill is only a stop-gap initiative and not to replace formal fugitive agreements in the long-run, to avoid abuses the following additional safeguards should be included in the Bill.","6/6/2019 15:44
抑郁毒心神探","PROPOSED PROCEDURES FOR FOO12. We ask that the Bill should include an amendment to section 23 of the FOO.13. Section 23 now provides as follows:“Admissibility of evidence, etc.(1) Any supporting document or other document which is duly authenticated is admissible in evidence in any proceedings under this Ordinance without further proof.” [emphasis supplied] …(4) Without prejudice to the generality of section 10(2)(b) or 12(4), in any proceedings under this Ordinance, any evidence which contradicts an allegation that a person sought to be surrendered under this Ordinance to a prescribed place has engaged in conduct which constitutes a relevant offence for which such surrender is sought is inadmissible and, accordingly-(a) that person is not entitled to adduce such evidence; and(b) any court is not entitled to receive such evidence.(5) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (4), in proceedings under this Ordinance evidence may be adduced for the purposes of showing that a person brought before the court of committal or any other court is not the person identified in the request for surrender to which the proceedings relate.”14. According to the above, the document in support for extradition could be admitted without further proof. Furthermore, any evidence to contradict the allegation raised by the requesting jurisdiction, save and except for identification, could not be adduced.15. The above provisions do not accord with the public expectation that if there are concerns on extradition, the defence should be given the right to challenge any prima facie evidence. We therefore ask the above sections (i.e. section 23(1), (4) and/or (5)) be amended to the extent that, apart from identification, the defence should be given the full right to be heard, including adducing evidence to test the credibility of the evidence presented against it. That would assist the magistrate in deciding whether a prima facie case has been made out, when it is to receive and consider evidence for the purpose of FOO. This proposal would be in accordance with the Government’s repeated reassurances that the Judiciary should be able to supervise the process.16. Subject to further research, we note the Extradition Act 2003 in the United Kingdom does not confer a “without further proof” privilege to the UK Government, insofar as admission of evidence is concerned (see section 202, Extradition Act 2003).","6/6/2019 15:44
抑郁毒心神探","INCLUDING COMMITTAL PROCEEDINGS INTO THE BILL17. In addition, we suggest that Part III of the Magistrates Ordinance Cap 227 (on committal proceedings and preliminary inquiry) should be adopted and be incorporated into the Bill, such that mandatory procedural requirements are laid down for both the Prosecution and the Defence to comply with - as in a routine criminal matter – and that, a defendant can give evidence and call evidence.18. The above reinforces the rights of a person under an extradition request to defend against such request. This is fundamental.CERTIFICATES BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE19. We understand that under the Part II of the FOO on the arrangement for the return of fugitives2 , the Chief Executive (CE) is not required to decide whether or not there is a prima facie case. He or she only asks whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant asking the magistrate to see if there is a prima facie case.20. The Bill now provides for a certificate to be issued by or under the authority of the CE to initiate a special surrender arrangement. From a legal perspective but not otherwise, we consider the Bill rightly does not disturb this procedural arrangement.21. However, in order to deal with the concerns of Hong Kong people on surrendering fugitives, there should be additional safeguards, set out in the following.22. We ask that when the CE is considering the issuance of the certificate, the CE should clearly list out in the certificate the criteria he or she has taken into account. Apart from the conditions such as those currently set out in some extradition treaties (e.g. with Germany or Singapore) where a party can refuse the surrender of a fugitive if it involves its own nationals, or if it would be incompatible with humanitarian considerations, there should be additional conditions, including (a) that the offence of which the surrender is sought is not political in nature, and (b) that the request should not be civil disputes disguised as criminal process. These additional requirements enhance the overall transparency of this makeshift process.23. We have not seen from the Government’s proposal the contents of the draft CE Certificate; we anticipate that its contents would be similar to Form 1 of the Fugitive Offenders (Forms) Regulation, Cap 503M. We reserve our comments on the contents of the Certificate, and the related matter generally.","6/6/2019 15:44
抑郁毒心神探","SCHEDULED OFFENCES24. Under the Bill, surrenders from Hong Kong pursuant to the special surrender arrangements cover only 37 items of offences, while 9 other items are excluded, based on their existing description in Schedule 1 of FOO, and the offences have to be ones punishable with imprisonment for more than three years or any greater punishment and triable on indictment in Hong Kong.25. We note a recent proposal of increasing the term to a seven-year imprisonment term. We consider that only those serious crimes should be subject to extradition.26. As for the scheduled offences, we have not been provided with any legal justification as to why those 9 offences currently appearing in the FOO are not included in the Bill itself, for example the “offences involving the unlawful use of computers”. These crimes could be committed quite easily across borders (geographical or jurisdictional), and could be prevalent. Without any legal reasoning, at the moment we are not convinced as to why the proposed special surrender arrangement does not cover these 9 categories of crimes.","6/6/2019 15:45
抑郁毒心神探","CONCERNS ON EXTRADITION TO MAINLAND CHINA27. We understand that the Bill is not drafted for surrender arrangement of fugitives only to Mainland China. However, seemingly most arguments advanced on the Bill have been focused on the supposition that the surrender arrangement will be used to send Hong Kong people to Mainland China, because of the concerns expressed on the criminal justice system.28. The singling out of a particular jurisdiction for comment is unfortunate and not helpful. Nevertheless, to assuage the concerns, we note with agreement a suggestion that it be made clear and explicit that the certificates of the CE are not issued other than pursuant to a formal request made through appropriate channels. In the case of Mainland China, the requests must be made by the Supreme People's Procuratorate (also known as the "Prosecutor General's Office" (最高人民检察院). This is the highest national level agency responsible for both prosecution and investigation in the People's Republic of China.29. Requests for surrenders should in any event not be made on spurious grounds. The above proposal would provide assurances that only properly formulated requests from the highest level of Prosecutorial Office in the Mainland China, are channelled to the HKSAR.30. As a further layer of protection, we also note the proposal that, before a one-off special surrender arrangement is to be considered by the CE, in the request itself, the requesting state / party should give an open undertaking that, if and when the fugitive is to be surrendered to the requesting state / party, he or she should have proper (a) rights to proper legal representation and (b) rights to visitation.","6/6/2019 15:45
抑郁毒心神探","THE ROLE AND THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT31. At the moment, the Court’s role in reviewing and rejecting a request for surrender of a fugitive is fairly limited.32. The jurisprudence of the Court in reviewing an extradition request is provided for under the FOO. That was explained in detail by the Court in the judgment of Tiongco and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines & Another HCAL 12/1998. In a subsequent judgment in Cosby v Chief Executive of the HKSAR HCAL 118/1999, the Court pointed out that (with emphasis supplied),(a) “it is the function of the magistrate in committal proceedings to restrict himself to the question of whether the evidence produced to him would, according to the law of the requested jurisdiction, amount to a (scheduled) offence in that jurisdiction and to abjure considerations of the substantive law of the requesting state”.(b) “The Fugitive Offenders Ordinance … has to cater for cooperation with territories which embrace disparate legal concepts, and crimes framed quite differently from ours. Hong Kong's extradition legislation, as well as its extradition agreements … strive to minimize the circumstances in which either the executive or the courts are required to examine the law of the requesting jurisdiction, and to maximize the emphasis upon conduct which in Hong Kong would constitute a scheduled crime.”(c) In any event, “[the] decision as to committal was to be based on evidence adduced at the committal hearing, and the decision whether that evidence justified committal was one to which English law alone was relevant … This decision, that the magistrate's task was to examine conduct, and not the constituent elements of the foreign offence, was followed in Hong Kong in Levy v. the Attorney General [1987] HKLR 777, in which the Court of Appeal added that it was also conduct, and not the foreign offence, "which the Governor considers when he decides whether to make an order requiring the magistrate to issue his warrant for the apprehension of the accused person." (per Roberts CJ at page 780).","6/6/2019 15:45
抑郁毒心神探","33. In a more recent judgment, the Court of Final Appeal re-affirmed that “the Magistrate merely had to determine whether a prima facie case existed to justify sending the defendant to face trial in the [requesting country] (Australia)” (with emphasis supplied) (see the judgment in Ho Man Kong v Superintendent of Lai Chi Kok Reception Centre FACV 13/2013, per Ribeiro PJ at page 184).34. We have in the preceding paragraphs already proposed legal amendments to the FOO and the Magistrates Ordinance. In addition, we suggest there should be an expansion of the Court’s criminal jurisdiction, by amending the Criminal Jurisdiction Ordinance Cap 461 to include murder and manslaughter into the scheduled offence of that Ordinance. Under this proposed amendment, the courts of Hong Kong could have extra-territorial jurisdictions to try a Hong Kong person who has committed a serious crime (murder or manslaughter) overseas in Hong Kong.35. On the Taiwan murder case which the Government has repeatedly been referring to, we acknowledge the different views as to whether an amendment to the FOO and/or the above-quoted Ordinance in the manner proposed could have retrospective effect. We take the view that to avoid any doubt over the issue, the Government could include an express provision for applicability to the Taiwan murder case.","6/6/2019 15:46
抑郁毒心神探","ADDITIONAL VIEWS36. The Law Society wishes to set out in this Submission the further views that the Law Society received on the matter. These views are equally valuable.37. According to these views, fundamentally, does Hong Kong need this piece of legislation?38. For one thing, the HKSAR Government has not explained satisfactorily or at all why in the last 20 odd years without extradition arrangements to Mainland China (or Taiwan), Hong Kong does not have any major problems in extradition. The circumstances which have now purportedly given rise to this sudden need for legislation are not persuasive, notwithstanding the repeated reliance by the Government on a murder case in Taiwan. As the matter now stands, the proposed case-by-case arrangement could easily and abusively be turned into a permanent mechanism to extradite Hong Kong people. In that case, the proposals, which are ill-conceived and hastily considered, would become entrenched. That will have profound and irreversible effects on the cherished status and the reputation of Hong Kong.39. The above worries are particularly grave when members of the public focus their attention on the differences between the criminal justice systems of HKSAR and that of the Mainland China. The prospect of being extradited to the Mainland China underpins their concerns, which are exacerbated in the light of the fact that Mainland China has signed but has not ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The legal amendments could thus be conveniently be used for political persecution and suppress freedom of speech.40. The proposed safeguards in the Bill do not address the above concerns. Among other things, the CE is politically appointed. Holder of the office is not subject to election by universal suffrage. Under this political arrangement, a Certificate from the CE cannot be any safeguard at all.","6/6/2019 15:46
抑郁毒心神探","41. Even assuming that the need for this piece of legislation could be justified, there is no convincing reason why the legislative exercise has to be urgent. In any event, there are other alternatives that could help address the problems (if any) that the Government has enunciated. For example, there could be legal amendments to include murder and manslaughter in the schedule (of 24 offences) which can currently be prosecuted in Hong Kong under Section 153P of the Crimes Ordinance Cap 200, even though the crimes may have taken place wholly outside Hong Kong.42. All in all, given the importance and the ramifications of this piece of legislation, the HKSAR Government ought to shelve the legislative exercise in order to give more time to examine closely the process and the arrangements proposed in the Bill. The need for the legislation must be satisfactorily addressed before the Law Society would consider in detail the legislative proposal itself, as a part of a 4511976 11 proper consultation process.","6/6/2019 15:46
抑郁毒心神探","CONCLUSION43. The Law Society received different views on the Bill, some of which are diametrically opposed (as we have illustrated). Divergence in the above speaks volumes on the controversy of the subject matter.44. Notwithstanding the differences, we believe that the legal analysis set out in the above, one way or the other, should carefully and thoroughly be considered by the HKSAR Government.The Law Society of Hong Kong5 June 2019 1 The term “extradition” in this paper is used by reference to FOO.2 The arrangement for the surrender of fugitive offenders has been summarized in a research report prepared by the Legislative Council Secretariat [March 2001] viz. “Research Study on the Agreement between Hong Kong and the Mainland concerning Surrender of Fugitive Offenders”https://thestandnews.com/politics/%E9%80%83%E7%8A%AF%E6%A2%9D%E4%BE%8B-%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E5%BE%8B%E5%B8%AB%E6%9C%83%E6%84%8F%E8%A6%8B%E6%9B%B8-%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E4%B8%8D%E6%87%89%E5%80%89%E4%BF%83%E4%BF%AE%E4%BE%8B/","6/6/2019 15:46

抑郁毒心神探","政府剔除九商罪　公会质疑做法欠基础政府的条例草案剔除了九项罪行类别，包括涉及破产、证券期货、知识产权、环保公众卫生、虚假商品说明等商业罪行，不作移交。与该九项罪行相关的管有或清洗所获的利益、阻止逮捕或检控、串谋，以及协助、教唆、怂使或促致他人犯罪，亦获豁免被移交。不过大律师公会批评，有关豁免欠缺原则基础支持，而政府除了表示「考虑过各项因素」之外，就没有进一步解释剔除九罪的理据。如果剔除九罪的动机，是因为忧虑有人被移交至中国大陆，这忧虑应该适用于所有罪行，而非仅当中九罪。公会质疑有关安排，并没有解决将逃犯移交中国的基本问题。政府剔除九罪，虽然似乎是要向商界提供保护，但大律师公会直指有关保护很可能只是「幻觉」。例如一个人若被指控涉及证券期货的罪行，通常都会同时被控欺诈，而后者并不获豁免。这些替代罪行亦足以将人移交到中国大陆。三年判监门槛仍涵盖大多数罪行修订条例草案提高单次移交疑犯门槛，只处理可判监超过三年的罪行。但大律师公会指，三年的门槛仍然涵盖香港目前大多数罪行，部分不一定由裁判法院处理。酒后驾驶、危险驾驶引致他人身体受严重伤害都达可移交门槛，盗窃、欺诈、贿赂等商业犯罪同样可被移交。「提高门槛不仅未有处现对《逃犯条例》草案的基本反对意见，对于关注中国、特别是内地刑事和司法制度的公民和香港市民而言，几乎是没有任何保障。」声明又指，鑑于香港与内地的相邻地理位置及紧密商贸关系，两地法院在不少案件上可能会享有并存的司法管辖权，但政府提出的修例建议，未有清楚交代在修例后，哪一个司法管辖区会享有优先处理权，或当事人是否仍有机会选择受哪一个司法管辖区监管。未确保能与台湾达成协议　港府不应仓卒立法大律师公会指，港府多次强调今次提出修例是为处理台湾杀人案，并称台湾当局过往曾三次要求港府移交逃犯，但大律师公会质疑，香港政府至今未回应台湾当局称，不会接受港府在「一中」前提下提出与台湾交涉。大律师公会认为，港府没有充分理据，在未能确保台港之间能达致有利协议的情况下，就仓卒通过具争议性及令人忧虑的法案。公会促请港府尽快进行广泛的公众谘询。https://thestandnews.com/politics/%E9%80%83%E7%8A%AF%E6%A2%9D%E4%BE%8B-%E5%A4%A7%E5%BE%8B%E5%B8%AB%E5%85%AC%E6%9C%83%E5%86%8D%E8%BD%9F%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C-%E6%BC%8F%E6%B4%9E-%E4%B9%8B%E8%AA%AA%E8%AA%A4%E5%B0%8E-%E6%9C%AA%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E8%B3%AA%E7%96%91-%E4%BF%83%E8%AB%AE%E8%A9%A2%E4%B8%8D%E6%87%89%E5%80%89%E5%8D%92%E7%AB%8B%E6%B3%95/","6/6/2019 15:50

抑郁毒心神探","【逃犯条例】大律师公会发表补充意见书ㅤ批政府新保障「十分不妥善」    （编按：政府强推《逃犯条例》修订，香港大律师公会今日（6 月 6 日）再次就此表达忧虑，补充意见书全文转载如下。）  香港大律师公会针对《2019 年逃犯及刑事事宜相互法律协助法例(修订)条例草案》的补充意见书 1. 公会于2019 年3 月4 日及2019 年4 月2 日曾两度提出意见书，重点如下：i) 没有必要过份放宽《逃犯条例》及《刑事事宜相互法律协助条例》以处理移交台湾杀人案疑犯的问题；ii) 非常怀疑是次修订能否实际上达致移交台湾杀人案疑犯；iii) 可以通过修订其他法例以确保台湾杀人案疑犯会被审讯；iv) 特区政府应解释政府根据甚么原因认为内地的人权状况及刑事司法制度在1997 后有重大改变以支持是次修订；v) 一次性个案移交安排将会成为香港与内地移交逃犯的惯例，尤其当长期移交逃犯安排不适用于中华人民共和国的任何其他部分的限制仍然存在；vi) 倘若立法会没有权限就一次性协议把关，法庭理应有权审批请求方的申请是否符合人权要求；vii) 没有任何原则性的理由将可判处最高刑期三年以下的罪行剔出一次性个案移交安排。 2. 保安局局长于2019 年5 月30 日宣布将就《2019 年逃犯及刑事事宜相互法律协助法例(修订)条例草案》（后称「《逃犯条例草案》」）作出多项修补，详情如下：i) 提高可移交逃犯的罪行门槛，定为可判处最高刑期七年或以上；ii) 请求方须要作出保证，有关罪行是在有效追诉期内；iii) 容许行政长官加入移交安排的条文，例如要求提出请求的司法管辖区须尊重无罪假定原则、公开审讯、探视权利、不能强迫认罪及上诉权；及iv) 就中国的任何其他部分而言，移交或没收的请求只能由最高人民检察院或最高人民法院提出。 3. 保安局局长于2019 年6 月1 日，在立法会保安事务委员会特别会议中回应张超雄议员的提问时，确认只会将移交罪行门槛提升到7 年修订写入《逃犯条例草案》。以上其他的建议只会以政策文件及惯例执行，并不会写入《逃犯条例草案》。","8/6/2019 19:41
抑郁毒心神探","将可移交罪行的可判处最高刑期提高至7 年或以上 4. 保安局局长承认将可移交罪行的可判处最高刑期提高至7 年或以上会剔除某些严重及滔天的罪行，例如刑事恐吓、将枪械或弹药交予无牌照的人管有、管有儿童色情物品、以虚假借口促致他人作非法的性行为、与年龄在16 岁以下的儿童性交、禁止利用、促致或提供未满18 岁的人以制作色情物品或作真人色情表演及促致年龄在21 岁以下的女童与人非法性交。 5. 是次缩小适用范围与特区政府声称回应「社会对制度上的漏洞所造成的不公义表示关注，亦有声音质疑特区当局对打击跨境严重罪行的决心」而提出修例的原因背道而驰。 6. 将可移交罪行的可判处最高刑期提高至7 年或以上并没有政策原因支持。其他与香港有长期相互协议的国家有明显较低的门槛（加拿大，澳洲，英国的长期安排均以1 年作为门槛）。给予涉嫌在内地干犯刑事罪行可判处最高刑期7 年以下的疑犯作出豁免并不符合修例政策原因。 7. 但更令人关注的是仍然有很多罪行需要移交逃犯，包括以欺骗手段取得财产、盗窃、欺诈、串谋欺诈、洗黑钱、勒索、管有虚假文书、行贿及贪污及作假证供等。 8. 公会仍然认为提高可移交罪行的可判处最高刑期，以给予在内地从事商业活动的人士提供保障的说法只不过是海市蜃楼，因为该等控罪均是一般移交请求所涉及的惯常控罪。","8/6/2019 19:41
抑郁毒心神探","其他「保障」 9. 保安局局长明确表明，其他新增的保障不会写入《逃犯条例草案》。反之，该些已承诺的保障只会由行政机关确保请求方履行。 10. 公会认为这是十分不妥善的做法。 11. 首先，此等保障全然依靠提出请求方的善意，而没有法律效力。被移交的人士及特区政府没有任何强制性方式令其他地区跟从。 12. 第二，保障的程度亦取决于特首与请求方的协议及这些地区与香港是否有对等关系。当关系并不对等，就如香港与内地的关系，便会令人怀疑特首有否能力要求对方承诺提供公平审讯、确保被拘留人士得到人道对待及会见律师的权利等，并向其明言一旦对方未能提供相关保障，移交的请求有机会遭拒绝。 13. 就着(i)在移交后，人权会否有机会遭受损害，及(ii)目前请求方的司法制度有否足够的人权保障，大律师公会认为以上两项问题均理应由法庭，而不是行政机关把关更为适合。独立的法庭是最适切、最具说服力及最有效的机关执行确保逃犯权利的角色。 14. 一项现行的做法是参考英国于在英国《引渡法案2003》 (UK Extradition Act 2003) 中加入第21 及83 条，要求法庭在处理移交会违反《人权法案1998》 (Human Rights Acts 1998) 所收纳的《欧洲人权公约》时，可解除逃犯的移交程序。 15. 就香港而言，相等的情况就会是要求裁判官在处理有机会违反《基本法》第39 条所收纳的《公民权利和政治权利国际公约》及《香港人权法案条例》下的权利的移交个案时，可解除对被移交人士的移交请求。 16. 在目前的方案中，若然请求方不守承诺，特区政府如何可以确保其会遵守人权保障的办法并不清晰。考虑如该名逃犯已被移交、其人权亦已受侵害的事实，任何抗议或反对实属徒然。基于特区政府与中央人民政府的不对等关系，特区政府将难以拒绝往后中央人民政府的移交逃犯要求，尤其是《逃犯条例》第24 条订明行政长官须遵从中央人民政府发出的指令。 17. 这做法并未能理想地履行香港特区政府于基本法第4 条下「依法保障香港特别行政区居民和其他人的权利和自由」的责任。大律师公会认为，真正有效令被移交人士不会遭受人权侵害的做法是容许及授权予法庭在该等情况下拒绝移交申请。 追诉期限制","8/6/2019 19:42
抑郁毒心神探","18. 香港特区政府指出，若然罪行在提出移交地方的追诉期已过，港府不会接纳移交的申请。 19. 大律师公会认为这保障的效果有限。《中国刑法》第87 条订明，若然犯罪时间已超过其法定最高刑的年期，如5 年、10 年、无期徒刑、或死刑的适用追诉期 ，则「不再追诉」。[1] 20. 但相关条例亦订明这个追诉时效期限有不少例外情况。如果当嫌疑犯「逃走」时，执法机关经已立案调查，追诉时效期限并不生效。同样地，倘若受害人已向执法机关投诉，追诉时效期限亦不生效。纵使追诉时效过了20 年，最高人民检察院仍可核准追诉。 21. 值得留意的是，《中国刑法》第89 条提到：「在追诉期限以内又犯罪的，前罪追诉的期限从犯后罪之日起计算」。换句话说，只要在追诉期限以内有新的控罪指控，旧有罪行的追诉期就可无限延伸。 22. 公会认为，这项「保障」充满不确定因素，亦不能保证一人因提控时效表面上已过而免于被控，因为一个或多个例外情况仍然可能适用。 由最高权力机关提出请求 23. 在政策文件及执行惯例订明起始的权力机关是不切实际。请求如何被呈交至最高权力机关，再由该机关提出请求，视乎法律程序和要求方的行政惯例。即使最高权力机关作出一个请求，引渡后如何处理该检控亦是未知之数。如受引渡人士会被送返提出请求的地方受审，而在当地制度欠缺正当法律程序，导致公平审讯权利不获保障，则仍会引起不安。 24. 再者，在这前提下，虽然表面上提高了要求，但《逃犯条例》第23 条关于认证要求的修订仍然存在。《逃犯条例草案》当中增加了一项条款，绕过第23 条(2)款中，即任何支持移交的文件须由司法人员或具资格的机关认证的条件。一次性个案移交安排是一个倒退，削弱了长期移交逃犯安排下惯常的保障。 %E5%96%84/[/url]","8/6/2019 19:42
抑郁毒心神探","相互法律协助 25. 除了修订《逃犯条例》以外，《逃犯条例草案》亦包括修改及移除《刑事事宜相互法律协助条例》中同样针对中国内地的限制。这方面的修订没有吸引如《逃犯条例》般的注意是因为这些修订并不影响人身自由。公会认为这些修订也值得在此深入探讨。 26. 简单而言，《刑事事宜相互法律协助条例》赋予特区政府权力作出安排，向提出请求地区就刑事事宜提供法律协助，包括对声称在提出请求地区干犯的罪行作出调查及检控，以及附属刑事事宜，例如执行外地没收令。 27. 特区政府可能提供的协助包括录取及提供证据、搜查、检取及作出命令要求提供有关调查或检控外地罪行的物件、就外地罪行交出香港囚犯作供、申请没收令、限制令、押记令以取回犯罪得益，但如请求的主要目的是评定或征收税项则除外。 28. 公会认为，《刑事事宜相互法律协助条例》经修订后，仅仅声称在中国内地进行刑事调查，而非检控，律政司司长及香港执法部门也可能在中国内地部门的要求下，向香港法庭申请任何上述的命令。因此，提出申请的门槛大大降低，提供协助前也不需要符合表面证据成立的条件。 29. 相比《逃犯条例》，《刑事事宜相互法律协助条例》中「双重犯罪」的要求更为广阔，因为协助请求所涵盖的罪行种类并无限制，有别于《逃犯条例》附表1 中列明的46 种罪行。相反，相互法律协助的唯一「双重犯罪」要求是，请求方所指的行为须在请求方的法律及香港法律下构成罪行或最高刑期两年或以上的严重罪行，除非该罪行属政治性质罪行、有违军法；请求提出的目的是基于某人的种族、宗敎、国籍或政治见解而对该人进行检控，或违反禁止「一罪两审」的原则。 30. 《刑事事宜相互法律协助条例》订明了门槛，控罪的最高刑罚最少只须达2 年监禁，就符合资格获得搜查、检取及没收形式的协助。换句话说，即使修订《逃犯条例》，将门槛提高至7 年监禁，也不适用于相互法律协助。即使香港居民面对的刑事调查或控罪，较经修订后《逃犯条例》中的罪行轻微，这些命令仍可以针对香港居民被滥用。","8/6/2019 19:42
抑郁毒心神探","31. 公会认为，《刑事事宜相互法律协助条例》的修订会大大加强经修订后《逃犯条例》中有关中国内地刑事检控的影响。当没有足够证据显示有足够表面证供以启动《逃犯条例》下的移交请求时，中国内地执法部门仍可以向香港法庭要求提供法律协助，从而搜查或检取证据达至足够表面证供，最终再将疑犯移交中国内地作出检控。 32. 再者，请求方的民事或刑事司法程序均可以在香港要求根据《刑事事宜相互法律协助法例条例》执行外地没收令。 33. 因此，公会认为所有关于人权及程序公义的忧虑，或就欠缺人权及程序公义的忧虑，同样适用于《刑事事宜相互法律协助法例条例》的修订。   香港大律师公会二零一九年六月六日   [1] 第八十七条【追诉时效期限】犯罪经过下列期限不再追诉:(一)法定最高刑为不满五年有期徒刑的,经过五年;(二)法定最高刑为五年以上不满十年有期徒刑的,经过十年;(三)法定最高刑为十年以上有期徒刑的,经过十五年;(四)法定最高刑为无期徒刑、死刑的,经过二十年。如果二十年以后认为必须追诉的,须报请最高人民检察院核准。 https://www.thestandnews.com/politics/%E9%80%83%E7%8A%AF%E6%A2%9D%E4%BE%8B-%E5%A4%A7%E5%BE%8B%E5%B8%AB%E5%85%AC%E6%9C%83%E7%99%BC%E8%A1%A8%E8%A3%9C%E5%85%85%E6%84%8F%E8%A6%8B%E6%9B%B8%E1%85%A0%E6%89%B9%E6%94%BF%E5%BA%9C%E6%96%B0%E4%BF%9D%E9%9A%9C-%E5%8D%81%E5%88%86%E4%B8%8D%E5%A6%A5%E5%96%84/","8/6/2019 19:43
