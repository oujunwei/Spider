胶八团","https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/impose-sanctions-upon-hong-kong-officials-who-are-acting-against-american-interests  Impose sanctions upon Hong Kong officials who are acting against American interests.  The Hong Kong government is on the verge of passing an extradition bill. If succeeds, US citizens travelling to Hong Kong would be at risk of being extradited to the Mainland China for crimes occurred there from the indefinite past, or ‘crimes’ fabricated by the PRC government to advance its political interests. In light of the ongoing trade war and past abductions of foreign citizens by Chinese agents, the risk facing US interests there is both tangible and unacceptable. We petition for the US Government to impose sanction against the Hong Kong politicians who push for this bills, and any individuals residing in the US with known ties to them. 简译：要求对推行逃犯条例之香港官员作出制裁  香港政府即将通过一项引渡条例。如果成功，到香港旅游之美国公民将面对被引渡至中国的风险，理因可以是无限过去时所犯下的罪行，或中国政府所炮制的「罪行」。有鑑于持续的贸易战以及中国特工过往曾在港抓获外国公民，美国在港利益面对的风险是实在且无法接受的。我们请愿要求美国政府对那些推动这条法案的香港政要，以及任何身居美国并与其有联系的人等，实施制裁。       兄弟，做嘢！      ","      兄弟，做嘢！
